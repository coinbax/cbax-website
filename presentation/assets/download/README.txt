COINBAX PRESENTATION DOWNLOAD

To provide a downloadable version of the pitch deck:

1. Place your final pitch deck PDF in this directory named "Coinbax_Pitch_Deck.pdf"

2. The download button on the last slide will automatically link to this file

3. Users will also be able to generate a PDF version directly from the web presentation using the "Download as PDF" button, which uses the html2pdf.js library

Note: The presentation can be exported to PDF from most presentation software like PowerPoint, Keynote, or Google Slides. Make sure the PDF matches the content and ordering of the web presentation for consistency.
